# Object oriented programming principles
## inheritance - child inherits parent's functionality
## encapsulation - encasulate entity's properties & methods in single entity, hide internal realization, provide external interface
## polymorphism - different realizators of interface can be processed similarly

# SOLID
## Single responsibility: 1 class = 1 responsibility
## Open/Close: any entity is opened for extension and is closed to modify
## Liskov's substitution: any entity can be replaced by descendant
## Interface segregation: interface implementers should not implement methods that do not use
## Depandency inversion: top level modules mustn't be dependent from low level modules (use weak dependency via interfaces)
