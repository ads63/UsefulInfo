# Object oriented programming principles
## inheritance - child inherits parent's functionality
## encapsulation - encasulate entity's properties & methods in single entity, hide internal realization, provide external interface
## polymorphism - different realizators of interface can be processed similarly
## abstraction - separation of the contract and its implementation using interfaces/protocols or abstract classes

# SOLID
## Single responsibility: 1 class = 1 responsibility
## Open/Close: any entity is opened for extension and is closed to modify
## Liskov's substitution: any entity can be replaced by descendant
## Interface segregation: interface implementers should not implement unused methods
## Dependency inversion: top level modules should not be dependent from low level modules. 
## Use weak dependency via abstraction (interfaces)
